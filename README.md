# VR Expedition to the black hole
Unity Build of the VR application “Expedition into the Black Hole”. The application is currently only available in German. 
The application was developed as part of the university competition 2023 “Our Universe” at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg and the Dr. Karl Remeis Observatory. 

## Das Team

- Dr. Annika Kreikenbohm (astrophysicist & freelance information designer) 
- Dr. Thomas Dauser (Post-Doc, Dr. Karl-Remeis Observatory in Bamberg)
- Prof. Tobias Günther (Professor for Visual Computing at the FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg) 
- Prof. Jörn Wilms (Professor of Astrophysics at FAU and at the Dr. Karl-Remeis Observatory)
- Blandina Mangelkramer & Laura Kneppe (FAU Press and Communications Office)

# System requirements
- Install the Unity software in version 2022.3 or newer
- User of one of the following VR glasses: Valve Index, HP Reverb G2
- Windows 10 or newer

# Set-up 
- Download the folder from this repository and unzip it to a location of your choice
- Before starting, make sure that the VR glasses are connected and ready to use.
- In the unzipped folder: Start the Windows application “VR Expedition in Schwarze Loch.exe”

# The expedition
Visitors using the application should be accompanied by researchers or similar. The expedition starts with a brief explanation of the controls. Experience has shown that users should familiarize themselves with it first. In the application, you are in the universe, the background image is a GAIA All Sky image and shows the universe from the point of view of the Earth. 

You are in the vicinity of a naked black hole. This may not be immediately recognizable. As soon as the initial explanation is finished, you can activate a compass in the menu on your right wrist that points in the direction of the black hole. You can freely explore the surroundings and the properties of the black hole. 

# Controls
There are various buttons / functions on the controllers:

## Left controller:
- Gravity sensor (button): generates vibrations in the left controller. The strength of the vibrations is a measure of the gravity at the player's position. If the person is too far away from the black hole, no vibration can be felt.

- Reset position (button): If you get too close to the black hole, there is an “error”, you fall into a gap and only see a hint. You can return to the game with the Reset Position button

- Audio Play/Pause (handle): activates or pauses an audio track that provides explanations about the environment, the black hole and the accretion. 

- Laser pointer (trigger/index finger): the laser pointer appears when you point the left controller at the menu on the right controller. The UI elements can be activated using the trigger buttons.

## Right controller:
- Menu: If you turn the right wrist / controller towards you (as if you were looking at your watch), a menu appears. The compass and info screen can be activated here. There is also a slider that controls the acceleration. You can use it to influence how much gas is accreted by the black hole (how pronounced the accretion disk is). 

The info screen provides additional information about the black hole and spiral galaxies. 

- Activate/deactivate light beams 
(trigger button/index finger):
To visualize the curvature of space, you can send out guide lines from the controller to show which path the light would take. The closer the light rays get to the black hole, the more they are deflected.

- Freezing light rays (handle): Unlike in reality, we can freeze light rays in the VR application. We can then see “from the side” how strongly the rays are deflected by the black hole. 

- Change the number of light rays (+/- buttons): the buttons can be used to vary the number of light rays. 

## Keyboard shortcuts:

- Spacebar / Space: Restart game
- ECS: End game
